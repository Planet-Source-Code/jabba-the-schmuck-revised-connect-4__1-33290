### Description

What can I say... I haven't seen any Connect 4 game with as many features as this one: 3 difficulty levels, falling pieces, sound, 2 player option(with an AI priority grid), a hint, and the option to change the direction of play(so that the pieces fall upwards). All my own work, check out the screenshot, comment - and vote if you like it.
 
### More Info
 
Might need to add the ImageList control from your components.
